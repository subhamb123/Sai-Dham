When we consider overwhelming problems regarding poverty, education, child labor, hunger, health care and more in our own community (or city, country or world at large), many among us feel deep sorrow but conclude there is nothing we can do. We feel powerless to stop it with individual capacity as the scale of problems is so immense. While such despair is understandable, the facts tell a very different story. There is nothing small or big when it comes to GIVE. It is about with how much love we give. Every single help or charity from you matters as when pooled together, its impact is significant and huge! We, the volunteers of "Shirdi Sai Dham, Bellevue", are highly influenced by Shirdi Sai Baba’s  teachings on compassion and charitable giving (in lot of ways it was the blueprint of His life!).
{/* </br> </br> */}
Baba has always encouraged charity and stressed the importance of sharing. He urged His devotees and followers to lead a moral life, to help others, and to love every living being without any discrimination. Through His own actions as an individual, He demonstrated how this could be done and showed that it was within the reach of the common man to demonstrate this level of compassion. For example, He often treated the sick and injured. He prepared food for His visitors, especially the poor. In His presence, all castes sat together on the ground. No one had an elevated position. 
{/* </br> </br> */}
He advised: “Unless there is some relationship or connection, nobody goes anywhere. Therefore, if any men or creatures come to you, do not discourteously drive them away, but receive them well and treat them with due respect.  Shri Hari (God) will certainly be pleased if you give water to the thirsty, bread to the hungry, clothes to the naked, and your verandah to strangers for sitting and resting. If anybody wants any money from you, and you are not inclined to give, do not give, but do not bark at him or her like a dog.”
{/* </br> </br> */}
This compassionate message was not just communicated orally; Shirdi Sai Baba demonstrated it through His every action. So we thank you in advance for all your help and effort!
